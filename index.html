<p> This is my very first foray into coding...ever! It feels like a ride on a new roller coaster - exciting and scary! Or maybe its more like traveling to a new country. I don't speak the language, but I'm excited to be here! Who knows - maybe by the end of this class, I'll be able to not only code and create my own webpage, but be able to help patrons with this sort of thing as well, even teach an intro class at the library! I'm good at user-end tech help, and looking (always) to be better. Anyway, here goes!</p>
